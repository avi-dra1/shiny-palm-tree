## Overview

This is a turn-based word puzzle game where you compete against GPT to form words using given letters. You get 28 seconds to form as many words as possible, and GPT gets 2 seconds. The player who forms the most words wins.

## Game Description

In this game, you will be presented with a grid of letters. Your task is to create valid words from these letters within a 28-second time limit. After your turn, GPT will have 2 seconds to form its own words from the same set of letters. The player (either you or GPT) who forms the most words at the end of the game wins.
